- [ ] Authentication system exists but not integrated with frontend
- [x] API calls are working: Yes (healthCheck and contentApi methods exist)

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- i18next for internationalization
- Zustand for state management
- React Query for data fetching
- React Router DOM for routing
- Axios for API calls
- SASS for styling

### Backend
- Express 4.19.2 with TypeScript
- Knex for database queries
- SQLite3 for development database
- JWT for authentication
- Helmet for security
- Swagger for API documentation

## Missing Critical Features
1. Frontend authentication flow not connected to backend
2. Video player integration incomplete
3. Offline support not fully implemented
4. Course content display needs backend integration
5. Progress tracking UI not connected to API
6. Assessment system UI missing
7. Admin dashboard not implemented

## Current Issues
1. Frontend and Backend are in separate folders but both have working API infrastructure
2. API base URL in frontend points to correct backend port (3001)
3. Database has migrations but needs seed data for courses
4. Authentication exists in backend but not integrated in frontend flow

## Next Steps
1. Ensure backend is running and accessible
2. Test API connection between frontend and backend
3. Create proper API integration for courses
4. Implement authentication flow
5. Add video content support
